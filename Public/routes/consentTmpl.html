  <h2>Patient Consent</h2>
  <p>
    As the patient—or as the authorized agent or legal representative of the patient—I consent and agree to the terms and conditions of this
    agreement. By signing below I intend that the following apply to all of the services performed by Leavitt Medical, Inc. (the “Provider”). I
    understand that the words, “I,” “me,” or “my” refer to me as the patient.
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Consent to Medical and Testing Services. I consent to health care services rendered by the Provider. Health care services include, but are not
      limited to, all health care and related medical and diagnostic services, the implementation of physician orders, and all tests, studies, and
      procedures ordered and performed in the good faith belief that they are either medically necessary or otherwise appropriate for me under the
      circumstances. I understand that:
       a. these health care services come with some risk, sometimes even the risk of substantial and serious harm, but I accept that risk in the hope of
      obtaining a good result;
       b. health care is an inexact science, in that there is always some uncertainty involved in its provision, and no one has made any promise about
      the outcome of the health care services.
    </li>
    <li>
      Confidential Information. Provider complies with state and federal laws in guarding the confidentiality of the patient medical records it makes,
      keeps and uses.
    </li>
    <li>
        Assignment of Benefits. By signing below, I hereby assign and transfer to the Provider, or any other health care provider for whom the Provider
        bills, the benefits of any insurance policy or other arrangement that may provide payment for some or all of my care.
    </li>
    <li>
      Tissue and Specimen Use and Disposal. I consent to the diagnostic study and disposal by the Provider of any blood, urine or other body fluids,
      or tissues which are obtained in accordance with routine medical practice. I further consent to the examination, study and retention of such
      specimens, as applicable by governmental regulations, and expect no compensation or other remuneration relating to the use of the findings for
      medical, scientific or educational purposes provided that the confidentiality of my identity is maintained.
